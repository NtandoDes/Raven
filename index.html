        <h2 class="section-title">Dear Siphumelele ,</h2>
        <p>
          They say we don't realize the value of someone until they're gone. Now that you're not by my side, I feel the emptiness you filled in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This letter is a reflection of my heart. A way to tell you that I understand where I went wrong. I didn't step up as a leader in our relationship. I was blinded by my own fears, too scared to embrace the love we shared fully. Instead, I let my insecurities define my actions. I failed you, and for that, I am truly sorry.

        <p>
          You inspired me in ways I couldn't understand back then. I took your kindness and love for granted, thinking you'd always be there. But now I see the truth: you deserved a love that uplifted you, and I fell short.
        </p>
        <p>
          This breakup opened my eyes to the kind of man I want to become. Not just for myself but for you‚Äîif there's ever a chance to mend our hearts together again.

          Thank you for being the light in my life, even in the darkest moments. No matter what the future holds, you deserve every ounce of happiness this world can give. And if you ever let me, I promise to spend my days showing you the love you truly deserve.
