        <h2 class="section-title">Dear Siphumelele ,</h2>
        <p>
         Now that you're not by my side, I feel the emptiness you filled in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This letter is a deep reflection of my heart, a heartfelt attempt to express the regret I carry and the lessons I‚Äôve learned. I now see where I went wrong, where I failed you. I didn‚Äôt step up when I should have‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt lead as I should have in our relationship. I was too consumed by my own fears and insecurities, too afraid to fully embrace the love we shared. Instead of being the partner you deserved, I let my doubts and uncertainties cloud my judgment and define my actions. For this, I am profoundly sorry. I became too comfortable in our relationship, allowing you to carry the weight that should have been shared. I failed you in ways I can never undo. I apologize for all the times I made you feel unimportant, for the times you felt unloved and unseen. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Ngiyonile into enhle‚ÄîI see now that I wasn't the man I thought I was. I was too full of myself, dismissing your feelings and your needs. In my arrogance, I failed to understand the true depth of your love. Life is a constant learning process, and we grow from the mistakes we make. I am sorry from the very core of my being, and I will spend the rest of my life learning to be a better man, a better partner. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, even if I don‚Äôt deserve it.

          You inspired me in ways I couldn't understand back then. I took your kindness and love for granted, thinking you'd always be there. But now I see the truth: you deserved a love that uplifted you and I fell short.

          This breakup opened my eyes to the kind of man I want to become. Not just for myself but for you‚Äîif there's ever a chance to mend our hearts together again.

        <p>
          Thank you for being the light in my life, even in the darkest moments. No matter what the future holds, you deserve every ounce of happiness this world can give. And if you ever let me, I promise to spend my days showing you the love you truly deserve. I‚Äôve learned from my mistakes and I am actively working on them every day. I know I still have a long way to go, but I promise you that I‚Äôm not the same person I was. I am more aware, more self-reflective, and more dedicated to being the partner you deserve.
